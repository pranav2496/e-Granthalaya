    <p  style="word-spacing:10px;">Librarians  need  to  be  aware  of  the many aspects of library management softwares and have a clear idea of the gaps in their library’s
    requirements so that they can form a proper technological plan for computerising and upgrading their libraries.  Speaking to the participants on 
    the need and importance of library automation and networking in the digital era, he talked the participants through the technical details of various
    library management softwares and introduced them to ‘eGranthalaya’ - the free library automation and networking .
             “Commercial library softwares like LibSys and ManLib are expensive, while in-house designs need a great deal of expertise,
             time and resources,” he said.

             of journals can be updated automatically, editing of records is possible and digital repositories of articles, newspapers and books can also be maintained.
